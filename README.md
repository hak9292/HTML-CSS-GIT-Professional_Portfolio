# HTML-CSS-GIT-Professional_Portfolio

Wrote out a basic sketch of what my webpage would look like
Then used Figma to get a more concrete visual of it

Realized that Figma would be somewhat overkill

Began to sketch more specifics:
    overall layout:
        ![overall](./assets/overall.png)
    column 1 layout:
        ![col1](./assets/col1.png)
    column 2 layout:
        ![col2](./assets/col2.png)
    column 3 layout:
        ![col3](./assets/col3.png)
    column 4 layout:
        ![col4](./assets/col4.png)

I changed the method/approach I took and redesigned everything.
